Setting up Rootless Containers doesn't need the root privileges basically, but some specific configuration
may need the root for the initial set-up.

- [Logging in](./login)
- [/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid](./subuid)
- [[Optional] cgroup v2](./cgroup2)
- [[Optional] Configuring sysctl values](./sysctl)
- [[Optional] Configuring AppArmor (Ubuntu 24.04 or later)](./apparmor)
