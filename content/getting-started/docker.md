title: Docker/Moby
weight: 20
---

Rootless Docker/Moby was implemented in 2018 following rootless runc, containerd, and BuildKit.
Rootless Docker has been merged to the Docker/Moby upstream since Docker 19.03.

Docker 19.03 provides almost full features for Rootless mode, including support
for port fowarding (`docker run -p`) and multi-container networking (`docker network create`),
but it doesn't support limiting resources with cgroup.

Docker 20.10 added support for limiting resources using cgroup v2.

## Installation

{{< hint info >}}
**Note**

Please read [the common steps](../common) first.

Especially, make sure [`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`](../common/login/) to be set properly.
{{< /hint>}}



{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "With RPMs/DEBs" >}}
Docker (since 20.10) provides `docker-ce-rootless-extras` RPMs and DEBs that can be installed by the root for all the users on the host.
The package is usually automatically installed on installing Docker from <https://get.docker.com>.

```bash
curl -o install.sh -fsSL https://get.docker.com
sudo sh install.sh
```

After installing Docker, run the following command as a non-root user to create the systemd user-instance unit:

```bash
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Without RPMs/DEBs" >}}
This method does not use RPMs/DEBS and can be executed by a non-root user without `sudo`.

```bash
curl -o rootless-install.sh -fsSL https://get.docker.com/rootless
sh rootless-install.sh
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}


## Usage

For backward compatibility, the `docker` CLI attempts to connect to the rootful daemon by default.

To connect to the rootless daemon, you need to set either the CLI context or an environment variable.

{{< tabs "docker-cli-config" >}}
{{< tab "CLI context (Modern)" >}}
```bash
docker context use rootless
docker run hello-world
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Env var (Classic)" >}}
```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock
docker run hello-world
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}


To start/stop the daemon, use `systemctl --user <start|stop> docker` instead of `systemctl <start|stop> docker`.
The systemd unit file is located as `~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service`.

## Tips
### Enabling resource limitations (`docker run --cpus`, `docker run --memory`, ...)

Resource-related flags of `docker run`, such as `--cpus`, `--memory`, `--blkio-weight`, and `--pids-limit` can be used only when the following conditions are satisfied:
* Docker/Moby version is 20.10 or later
* containerd version is 1.4 or later
* runc version is 1.0-rc91 or later
* The host is running with [cgroup v2](/getting-started/common/cgroup2)
* The host is running with systemd

To impose resource limitations without cgroup, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/#limiting-resources

### Changing the network stack
Docker/Moby uses [slirp4netns](/glossary#slirp4netns) as the default network stack if slirp4netns v0.4.0 or later is installed.
Otherwise it falls back to [VPNKit](/glossary#vpnkit).

slirp4netns is usually automatically installed on installing the `docker-ce-rootless-extras` package.
If slirp4netns is not automatically installed, run `sudo apt-get install slirp4netns`, `sudo dnf install slirp4netns`, or download [the official slirp4netns binary](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns)
to `~/bin` so that Docker/Moby can pick it up automatically. The functionalities are same as VPNKit, but slirp4netns is known to have better throughput.

Docker/Moby also supports [lxc-user-nic SETUID binary](/glossary#lxc-user-nic) experimentally: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/#changing-the-network-stack

### Changing the port forwarder

Docker/Moby uses [RootlessKit](/glossary#rootlesskit) as the default port forwarder.

However, as explained in [How it works](/how-it-works/netns/incoming/), sometimes
slirp4netns port forwarder is preferred over RootlessKit port forwarder.

To change the port forwarder to slirp4netns, create `~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/override.conf` with the following content:

```
[Service]
Environment="DOCKERD_ROOTLESS_ROOTLESSKIT_PORT_DRIVER=slirp4netns"
```

And then restart the daemon:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload 
systemctl --user restart docker
```

### Starting containers on boot

You need to run `sudo loginctl enable-linger ...`. See [Getting Started/Login](/getting-started/common/login/).

### Resetting to factory settings

Run the following commands to remove all containers and configurations:
```bash
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh uninstall
~/bin/rootlesskit rm -rf ~/.local/share/docker ~/.config/docker
```

To uninstall binaries, run `sudo apt-get remove docker-ce-*`
or `sudo dnf remove docker-ce-*`.

If you installed Rootless Docker without using packages,
remove the following files under `~/bin`:
```
containerd
containerd-shim
containerd-shim-runc-v2
ctr
docker
docker-init
docker-proxy
dockerd
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh
dockerd-rootless.sh
rootlesskit
rootlesskit-docker-proxy
runc
vpnkit
```
